A Brief Introduction to Wlpp+
=============================
This project aims to create a simple, ease to use language that is similar
to C, while also acts as a very good exercise for myself. The idea came from
the compiler project from my university class CS241, and the simple language
we were required to implement - "Wlpp".

Wlpp is a very simple language that is very much just a dumb-down version
of C. In fact, a complete Wlpp program can work as a function in any C
programs. Wlpp was created because the univsersity wanted something simple
and easy for second year students to implement. However, simplicity is
also Wlpp's biggest disadvantage. It is simply not enough to do anything
more than writing a simple bubble sort or the likes. For example, it only
supports two data types: int and int* ! So, I decided to add more firepower
to the "toy" language to make it less like a toy, aka WLPP+ ! (^_^)

Wlpp+ aims to be a lot more powerful than Wlpp and at the same time keep
the simplicity of the original design purpose. First of all, a boolean type
is added, along with char in the near future. I'm also considering adding
char*, since it is definitely nice to be able to display meaningful messages
instead of only writing a program that does only arithmetic operations.
Functions are definitely coming to Wlpp+, but no function overloading; that
is just too much C++ complexity.
